## Loading and preprocessing the data

##  1.  Load the data (i.e. read.csv())
##  2.  Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

  # Store dataset file name in a vector
  projfile = "activity.zip"
  
  # Store location of the dataset file in a vector
  source_url = "https://github.com/profkumar/RepData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/activity.zip"
  
  # If dataset is not already on the computer in the working deirectory, 
  # download it firstfrom the above location and store as vector as mentioned above  
  if(!file.exists(projfile)) {
    download.file(source_url, destfile = projfile, method="curl")
  }
  
  # Unzip the available (or downloaded) zipped dataset file and store into a vector
  fileunzip <- unz(projfile, "activity.csv")
  
  # Read unzipped csv file, define classes (according to assignment details) of column in it 
  # (so that there are no mistakes)
  myfile <- read.csv(fileunzip, header = TRUE, colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "numeric"))
  
  # convert "interval" column into factors

############ START OF QUESTION 4 ############

# Imputing missing values

# We earlier noted that there are many missing values (coded as NAs) in the dataset. 
# The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data

# Question 4: 
# Part 1:
# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset 
# (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs).

# Part 2:
# Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. 
# The strategy does not need to be sophisticated.
# For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, 
# or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

# Part 3:
# Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but 
# with the missing data filled in.

# Part 4:
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report 
# the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
# Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
# What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of 
# steps?
